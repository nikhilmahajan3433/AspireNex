Project Overview:-

This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset using machine learning techniques.

 The primary challenge is to address the class imbalance problem, where the number of fraudulent transactions is significantly lower than non-fraudulent ones.

 The project is implemented in both R and Python and includes data preprocessing, resampling strategies to handle class imbalance, model training, and evaluation.
